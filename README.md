# Sales_Forecasting-using-SARIMA
In this project, I will be forecasting the  future sales of  Walmart company on the basis of hierarchical sales in the states of California, Texas, and Wisconsin. Forecasting sales, revenue, and stock prices is a classic application of machine learning in economics, and it is important because it allows investors to make guided decisions based on forecasts made by algorithms. In this project,a brief explanation of the structure of dataset is  presented and description of all the process that is being involved in data cleaning is  well presented. Then, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is done where I have visualized the dataset using Matplotlib and Plotly. And finally, I have demonstrated how this problem can be approached with a variety of forecasting algorithms.

Understanding the Dataset


First let’s understand the dataset and what all details are being given to us to approach the problem. The Dataset can be found from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy/data
If we download the dataset we are provided 5 csv files out of which 3 csv files are of our interest. First dataset given is “sales_train_validation.csv”. This dataset contains the historical daily unit sales data per product and store and state id’s . 
Second dataset is “sell_prices.csv”. This contains information about the price of the products sold per store and date and also contains information of product_id’s . Third Dataset is “calendar.csv” which includes information about the dates on which the products are sold.

Since this Jupyter notebook contains plotly graphs and github cannot plot the dynamic graphs so graphs are not visible in the jupyter notebook.To view my wholework in jupyter notebook with graphs click the following link below:

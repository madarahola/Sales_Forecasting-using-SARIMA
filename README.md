# Sales_Forecasting-using-SARIMA
In this project, I will be forecasting the  future sales of  Walmart company on the basis of hierarchical sales in the states of California, Texas, and Wisconsin. Forecasting sales, revenue, and stock prices is a classic application of machine learning in economics, and it is important because it allows investors to make guided decisions based on forecasts made by algorithms. In this project,a brief explanation of the structure of dataset is  presented and description of all the process that is being involved in data cleaning is  well presented. Then, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is done where I have visualized the dataset using Matplotlib and Plotly. And finally, I have demonstrated how this problem can be approached with a variety of forecasting algorithms.
